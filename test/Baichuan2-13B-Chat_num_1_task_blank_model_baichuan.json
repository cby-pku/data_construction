Ask them to describe a specific project or challenge they faced in the past, and how they overcame it. This will give you an idea of their problem-solving abilities and how they work under pressure.\n\n3. Talk to the person about their goals and aspirations. This will help you understand if they align with your company's values and vision. Additionally, this will give you an idea of their motivation and drive to succeed in their role.\n\n4. Find out if they have any hobbies or interests outside of work. This can give you insight into their personality and ability to connect with colleagues on a personal level.\n\n5. Asking behavioral interview questions can also help you get to know the person better. For example, you could ask them to describe a situation where they had to work with someone they didn't get along with, and how they handled it. This will give you an idea of their communication and teamwork skills.\n\n6. Finally, don't be afraid to ask open-ended questions that encourage the candidate to share their thoughts and opinions. This will give you a better idea of their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities."
